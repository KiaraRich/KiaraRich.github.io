## 🎓 Education
👩‍🎓 Rice University 2026 - Master of Engineering Management & Leadership with Specialization in Data Science

I am currently pursuing a Master's in Engineering Management & Leadership with a focus on Data Science. This program combines advanced technical skills with leadership strategies, equipping me to manage complex engineering projects and lead data-driven decision-making processes.

📚 Notable Projects
- Currently in my first semester and looking forward to future projects that integrate leadership and data science!

👩‍🎓 Rice University 2024 - Master of Computational and Applied Mathematics

I earned my Master's in Computational and Applied Mathematics, where I developed advanced mathematical and computational techniques to solve real-world problems. This program deepened my expertise in modeling, optimization, and automation, laying a strong foundation for tackling complex challenges in engineering and data science.

📚 Notable Projects
- **Research Paper:** Cybersecurity - Identifying Civilian Threats and How to Protect Against Them
  - Explored methods to protect data, networks, and devices from unauthorized access and cyber threats such as malware, phishing, and identity theft. Proposed practical strategies like antivirus software, multi-factor authentication, and data backups to enhance security.

- **Project:** Exploring Potentially Hazardous Near-Earth Objects
  - Explored the Tisserand Parameter, a key measure in orbital mechanics used to classify and track the trajectories of near-Earth objects (NEOs), potentially hazardous objects (PHOs), and comets relative to Jupiter. Developed data science models to analyze asteroid and comet properties, leveraging orbital characteristics such as semi-major axis, eccentricity, and inclination. Demonstrated how the Tisserand Parameter can classify bodies as comets ($𝑇_𝐽 \leq 3$) or asteroids ($𝑇_𝐽 \geq 3$) and highlighted its application in identifying extinct or inactive comet nuclei. This work underscores its critical role in planetary defense and understanding our solar system's evolution.
