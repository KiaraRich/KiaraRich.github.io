🛠️ Exploring Potentially Hazardous Near-Earth Objects

Explored the Tisserand Parameter, a key measure in orbital mechanics used to classify and track the trajectories of near-Earth objects (NEOs), potentially hazardous objects (PHOs), and comets relative to Jupiter. Developed data science models to analyze asteroid and comet properties, leveraging orbital characteristics such as semi-major axis, eccentricity, and inclination. Demonstrated how the Tisserand Parameter can classify bodies as comets (𝑇 < 3) or asteroids (𝑇 > 3) and highlighted its application in identifying extinct or inactive comet nuclei. This work underscores its critical role in planetary defense and understanding our solar system's evolution.

📜 Higher Order Hyperbolic Equations with Constant Coefficients 

Hyperbolic equations are a type of partial differential equation (PDE) that describe wave-like phenomena where disturbances propagate with finite speed. These equations are fundamental in modeling various real-world applications, such as sound waves, electromagnetic waves, and seismic waves. This paper explores higher-order hyperbolic equations with constant coefficients, focusing on methods like Fourier transforms, separation of variables, and characteristic equations to find solutions.

📜 Spectral Methods for Partial Differential Equations
  
The spectral method is a powerful numerical technique for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by representing solutions as a weighted combination of basis functions. Unlike finite difference or finite element methods, which focus on local approximations, spectral methods provide superior accuracy for problems with smooth solutions and regular domains. This project explores spectral methods applied to the heat equation in 1D and 2D, comparing their accuracy and performance against finite difference methods.
