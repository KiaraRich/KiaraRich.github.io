🛠️ Exploring Potentially Hazardous Near-Earth Objects

Explored the Tisserand Parameter, a key measure in orbital mechanics used to classify and track the trajectories of near-Earth objects (NEOs), potentially hazardous objects (PHOs), and comets relative to Jupiter. Developed data science models to analyze asteroid and comet properties, leveraging orbital characteristics such as semi-major axis, eccentricity, and inclination. Demonstrated how the Tisserand Parameter can classify bodies as comets (𝑇 < 3) or asteroids (𝑇 > 3) and highlighted its application in identifying extinct or inactive comet nuclei. This work underscores its critical role in planetary defense and understanding our solar system's evolution.

📜 Higher Order Hyperbolic Equations with Constant Coefficients 

Hyperbolic equations are a type of partial differential equation (PDE) that describe wave-like phenomena where disturbances propagate with finite speed. These equations are fundamental in modeling various real-world applications, such as sound waves, electromagnetic waves, and seismic waves. This paper explores higher-order hyperbolic equations with constant coefficients, focusing on methods like Fourier transforms, separation of variables, and characteristic equations to find solutions.

📜 Spectral Methods for Partial Differential Equations
  
The spectral method is a powerful numerical technique for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by representing solutions as a weighted combination of basis functions. Unlike finite difference or finite element methods, which focus on local approximations, spectral methods provide superior accuracy for problems with smooth solutions and regular domains. This project explores spectral methods applied to the heat equation in 1D and 2D, comparing their accuracy and performance against finite difference methods.

### 👩‍🎓 Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University 2018-2022 | B.S. Computational Mathematics with Minors in Astronomy/Astrophysics and Humanities

Originally pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Astronomy/Astrophysics with minors in Applied Mathematics and Humanities, I made the decision in Spring 2021 to shift my major to Computational Mathematics. Although this change came late in my academic career, it allowed me to fully leverage my strengths and excel in advanced mathematics courses. This program provided me with a strong foundation in mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, and problem-solving techniques. Coupled with my minors, I gained a deeper understanding of astrophysical phenomena and developed critical thinking skills through the study of humanities. These experiences prepared me to approach complex problems with both technical precision and a broad, interdisciplinary perspective.

#### 📚 Notable Projects and Research Papers

✍️ “When the Shadows Come” – A “Game of Rat and Dragon” and Black Panther Crossover Fanfiction

*“When the Shadows Come”* is a science-fiction fanfiction story that combines elements from the film *Black Panther* and the story *Game of Rat and Dragon*. This creative crossover explores themes of progressional change and self-reflection. Shuri, a character who symbolizes innovation and leadership, is at the center of this narrative. Shuri represents progressional change in several impactful ways. (1) Her role as the head scientist of Wakanda challenges traditional views of women in STEM and minority representation in science. (2) In this story, she ascends to the throne at just 16 years old, transitioning Wakanda from its patriarchal traditions to a matriarchal leadership system. (3) Her belief in innovation and improvement—captured in her quote, *“Just because something works, doesn’t mean it can’t be improved”*—aligns with the theme of societal progression. This story is a testament to the power of representation and the importance of embracing change as a means to thrive and grow.

✍️ "Her Condolences: A Warrior’s Journey Exhibited as a Short Novel"

For my Mythology Capstone assignment, I chose to write a series of short stories told from the perspective of Artemis. These stories come together as a short novel titled *Her Condolences*. Each chapter explores Artemis’ character and role as a goddess, offering a deeper understanding of her personality and motives. While each chapter is adapted from a traditional myth, I reimagined the narratives by incorporating Artemis’ unique perspective, highlighting what I believe to be key aspects of the original stories. Each chapter begins with a summary of the original myth, providing context for my adaptation. The title, *Her Condolences*, reflects the idea that Artemis is offering her grievances to the figures in the original myths. The novel unfolds as an action-packed story, portraying women as strong, dynamic warriors in a way that captivates the audience.
